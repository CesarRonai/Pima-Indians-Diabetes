# Diabetes Prediction

This project uses Machine Learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on clinical data. The trained model uses the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset and implements binary classification algorithms.

## Project Description

This project aims to build and train a predictive Machine Learning model for binary classification. We used the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, which contains patient information such as the number of pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, and other relevant variables. From these features, the model predicts whether a patient has diabetes.

The goal is to provide an effective approach for the early diagnosis of diabetes using clinical data.

## Data Used

The dataset used in this project is publicly available and contains the following features:

- **Pregnancies**: Number of pregnancies.
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration in 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
- **Insulin**: Serum insulin levels (mu U/ml).
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in mÂ²)).
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function (family history).
- **Age**: Age (years).
- **Outcome**: Target class (0: non-diabetic, 1: diabetic).
